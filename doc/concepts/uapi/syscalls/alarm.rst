"""""""""

**API definition**

   .. code-block:: rust
      :caption: Rust UAPI for alarm syscall

      mod uapi {
         fn alarm(timeout_ms: u32) -> Status
      }

   .. code-block:: c
      :caption: C UAPI for alarm syscall

      enum Status sys_alarm(uint32_t timeout_ms);

**Usage**

   Ask the kernel to emit a SIGNAL_ALARM signal in `timeout_ms` miliseconds to the current job.

   This syscall is usefull when implementing userspace software-based timers. Although, there
   are some restrictions:

      * requested alarms can't be removed before they expire
      * the system support a maximum number of concurrently configured alarms upto one alarm
        per task if all task requires an alarm in the same time


   .. code-block:: C
      :linenos:
      :caption: sample bare usage of sys_alarm

      if (sys_alarm(200) != STATUS_OKAY) {
         // [...]
      }
      res = sys_wait_event([...]);
      /* alarm received 200ms later */

   .. note::
      as SIGNAL_ALARM can also be emitted by other tasks through the signal syscall, the
      alarm emitted by the kernel due to a alarm() request hold the current task
      identifier as signal source

**Required capability**

   None.

**Return values**

   * STATUS_BUSY if the delay manager do not have any space for the requested alarm
   * STATUS_OK
