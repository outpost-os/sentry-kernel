Security requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiple security considerations have been taken into account at design time.
These considerations are the consequence of a security study with respect for
the core usage of the Outpost OS and the Sentry kernel, which targets small embedded
systems.

The consideration are the following:

   1. As much as possible properties must be a build-time information that can be
      verified before flashing the target. To achieve that, Sentry kernel consider
      a lot of information as being build-time produced. Typically:

      * task list
      * each task capabilities
      * each task memory mapping
      * each task list of allowed devices
      * each task list of allowed shared memory
      * each task list of allowed DMA streams
      * each task integrity signature (HMAC generation)
      * each task metadata integrity signature (HMAC generation)
      * device tree configuration (for both kernel and userspace driver)
      * IPC communication channel allowance between tasks

   2. Exchanges between tasks are controlled, as such, the following restrictions exists:

      * no broadcast IPC emission
      * no broadcast signal emission
      * a device (as declared in the device tree) is strictly dedicated to a given task (including pinmuxes for LEDs for e.g.)
      * a shared-memory can be mapped at most in two task at a time
      * shared memory ownership is always kept under the control of the initial SHM declarator

   3. Exchange between tasks and Sentry kernel

      * No pointer is ever transmitted between userspace tasks and Sentry kernel. Instead tasks are
        using :ref:`handles <handles>` and a dedicated small memory region denoted `svc_exchange` for
        non-scalar data transmission and syscall data return (see
        :ref:`userspace / kernelspace data transmission concepts <svc_exchange>` chapter).

   4. memory mapping is fully restricted

      * except SHM, task memory mapping are strictly separated (check at build time)
      * Sentry kernel is a monitor, not god: it do not have access to task memory map, excepting
        the task `svc_exchange`. Only handler entrypoint manipulate the task stack for saving/restoring
        the task context, just before demapping the task region
      * All mapped regions respect the `W^X` principle

   5. security events consideration

      * Security related events are considered in Sentry, through the usage of the `sigabort`
        post-mortem service. Any abnormal event that generate an invalid task termination
        generate a call to this runtime post-mortem service in the task context with a fresh
        stask. If the task developer implement a sigabort hook, it will be executed
      * In release mode, any security level return code (abnormal return code considered as
        a security exception) generates a panic call which lead to a full reset
      * *TBD*: any abnormal event that generate a board reset aim to be stored in a dedicated,
        encrypted, flash memory dedicated area, in a specific binary formatted structure for
        post-mortem analysis after dump and decryption
      * Sentry kernel include various security whatchdogs that are proactively executed regulary
        (at syscall time or schedule time) to check kernel-related content state (MPU configuration,
        hardware registers states, etc.) Any fail lead to a security `panic()`.

   6. bootup and modes

      * Sentry build natively supports three modes: `debug`, `autotest` and `release`
         * **debug**: debug manager is compiled and linked, adding usart and other debug features.
           Some debug-related feature that may reduce security can be activated. The build system
           inform the developer that the kernel is built in debug mode and MUST NOT be used in production
         * **autotest**: debug manager has debug line activated, but other features are in release mode.
           The kernel do not parse the task metadata list but instead spawn a single task denoted
           `autotest` in order to execute various uapi and kernel-space tests (security, performances)
           on the hardware target. See :ref:`autotest chapter<autotest>` for more informations.
         * **release**: all debug are deactivated, all enforcement are activated and can't be deactivated
           even through the configuration GUI. This include overall bootup integrity checks (task HMACs),
           MPU hardening and various periodic security watchdogs

  single: stack-smashing-protection; implementation

About stack smashing protection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stack smashing protection is a basic protection mechanism that include in each stack frame
a guardian that is forged at runtime during function preamble and checked at function postambule.

This guardian is denoted Canary and is manipulated by compiler's primitives that are embedded
in the software runtime, called during each stack frame creation and leave.
This primitives are activated with the usual `stack-protector`, `stack-protector-strong`, flags,
and need to be seeded at runtime for each thread in order to generate per-stack entropy, so that
each thread has its own canary sequence.


In order to seed each task thread, Sentry kernel, in association with the userspace `_start`
entrypoint implementation, deliver a per-job seed.
The seed is pushed, at job startup, as the second argument of the entrypoint.
On ARM architecture, the ARM calling convention is using r0-r3 for the fourth first
function arguments, and as such, the seed is passed directly through the `r1` register
at job bootup.

This requires that the entrypoint respect the `_start` symbol as defined in
:ref:`job entrypoint section <job_entrypoint>`.

.. note::
  The usage of `_start` symbol in the application runtime allows to properly forge
  application environment at job boot time, and properly support application termination
  at job end time without requiring any single line of code from the application developer

.. warning::
  The `_start` implementation, while being a part of the overall runtime, is not
  under Sentry responsability, but instead hosted in the userspace runtime, typically
  libShield for POSIX or Rust Sentry HAL

About compile-time hardening
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sentry kernel natively supports compiler-delivered hardening options, automatically checked
at configure time.

Supported compiler featuresets are the following:

   * **harden-compares**: For every logical test that survives GIMPLE optimizations and is not
     the condition in a conditional branch (for example, conditions tested for conditional
     moves, or to store in boolean variables), emit extra code to compute and verify the
     reversed condition, and to call __builtin_trap if the results do not match.

   * **harden-conditional-branches**: For every non-vectorized conditional branch that survives
     gimple optimizations, emit extra code to compute and verify the reversed condition, and to
     call `__builtin_trap` if the result is unexpected. Use with `-fharden-compares` to cover all
     conditionals.

   * **harden-control-flow-redundancy**: Emit extra code to set booleans when entering basic
     blocks, and to verify and trap, at function exits, when the booleans do not form an execution
     tree that is compatible with the control flow graph.

   * **hardcfr-check-returning-calls**: When `-fharden-control-flow-redundancy` is active, check
     the recorded execution path against the control flow graph before any function call
     immediately followed by a return of its result, if any, so as to not prevent tail-call
     optimization, whether or not it is ultimately optimized to a tail call.

These flags are mostly activated starting with gcc >= 14.

.. note::
   As these flags may highly impact the generated kernel size, they are not activated by default.
   The flag activation can easily be made using `menuconfig`, or set into a given defconfig file.



.. todo::
   The `__builtin_trap` symbol must be wrapped so that we take control on fault detection

About the usage of anti-temper detection coprocessor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Typically, on stm32u5 SoC, the TAMP coprocessor is used in order to support fast key erasing on
tampering detection. The key erasing is also triggered when the `__builtin_trap` is executed.

.. todo::
  The trap to temper subsystem still need to be implemented, starting with STM32U5 SoC but may
  also be considered on other SoCs that have an equivalent anti-tempering IP
