//! sentry_uapi is the user API library that delivers a full access to the Sentry kernel
//! interface.
//! This crate aim to be used by any Outpost-OS Rust application.
//!
//! -**Data types** — Sentry_uapi provices a complete set of data types and
//!  values that are required in order to properly exchange informations with the Sentry kernel.
//!  All the data types are stored in the [`mod@systypes`] public module.
//!
//! -**Sentry syscalls** — Syscall are defined in a two layers way. The bare syscalls
//!  are implemented in the [`mod@syscall`] module, while the upper, easy interface
//!  is out of the scope of this very crate, and written in the shield crate instead.

/// Sentry UAPI C export interface module
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This module should not be used in a full Rust application, while this is the lonely
/// accessible interface in C.
/// This allows a full Rust usage without extern C and thus unsafe calls when
/// writing Rust application with cargo
/// interface is used. Sentry kernel interactions should be, instead, made with
/// a upper interface such as shield.
///
pub mod ffi_c;

/// Sentry kernel exchange area manipulation primitives
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This module should not be used directly unless the [`mod@syscall`] module
/// interface is used. Sentry kernel interactions should be, instead, made with
/// an upper interface.
///
/// As the exchange area is a special userspace/kernelspace fixed size area
/// made in order to exchange data between userspace and kernelspace without
/// manipulating any pointer, this space has a particular meaning and usage, holding
/// any type of content as a 'retention area' before and after system calls.
/// This area is exclusive to the current job.
///
/// # About unsafe in this module
///
/// This module needs to interact with a single, static mutable area where both
/// kernel and job exchange data. As such, Rust consider any manipulation of this
/// area as unsafe due to potential multiple references to a static mutable space.
///
/// As Sentry kernel ensures that any job being executed has a single thread, no
/// race condition can happen due to the overall system design. As a consequence, even
/// if unsafe is used, there is no UB risk when manipulating the exchange area
/// based on the Operating System architecture.
///
mod exchange;

/// Sentry kernel low level syscall implementation
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This module is responsible for calling the kernel gate through the target
/// architecture supervisor access opcode, in interaction with the corresponding
/// arch backend.
///
/// There is no abstraction at this module's level and should not be used directly,
/// but instead with an upper interface such as shield
///
/// > **NOTE**: This module may not be kept public forever
///
pub mod syscall;

/// Sentry kernelspace/userspace shared types and values
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This module holds all the Sentry kernel types and values required by all other modules
/// but also types that need to be used by upper layers in order to properly manipulate
/// Sentry's syscalls.
///
/// This module do not hold any function nor macro, but only all scalar and non-scalar
/// types for userspace/Sentry-kernel exchanges.
///
/// Some types are snake case based because of the C export. None the less,
/// they will be moved to standard Rust Caml case to stay conform to the
/// Rust guildelines
///
/// > **Note**: there is no bindgen nor cbindgen call in order to ensure FFI
/// > interface with the C language, to avoid any inter-languages naming and
/// > complexity (macros cases, static inline case and so on), meaning that
/// > the corresponding C types are defined in a dedicated include dir
